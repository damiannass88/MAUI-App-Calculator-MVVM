# MAUI App Calculator MVVM

<b>First work with MAUI Platform</b>
<br>
Using the Microsoft documentation for the MAUI Platform: [[a link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/), I created a universal cross-platform mini-calculator project. Assumptions were to make a universal nice design and to separate view relationship from logic.
